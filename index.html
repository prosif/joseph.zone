            I'm Joseph and I like programming, hip-hop, burritos and some other stuff. I'm currently a "cloud engineer" at <a href="https://unearthlabs.com" target="blank">Unearth</a> where I do infrastructure stuff and platform development. Prior to Unearth I was at Amazon working on internal tools for Prime Now & <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/hyprank-how-alexa-determines-what-skill-can-best-meet-a-customers-need" target="blank">machine learning stuff for Alexa</a>. Before that, I was a student developer at <a href="https://cyverse.org/" target="blank">CyVerse</a> where I worked on a cloud computing platform called <a href="https://cyverse.org/atmosphere" target="blank">Atmosphere.</a>

            In my free time I work on <a href="https://homegames.io" target="blank">Homegames</a> with my friend Yazeed. We do a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZjCaMQld0OcBqKgOIUiez?si=aPlF7T1OTF2ljuxTiYsEng" target="blank">weekly podcast</a> where we talk about Homegames development and a lot of other stuff.
